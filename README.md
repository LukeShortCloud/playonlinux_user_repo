# PlayOnLinux User Repository (PUR)

This is a collection of unofficial PlayOnLinux scripts to help run Windows games on Linux. These will get faster updates than the official PlayOnLinux scripts.

Open the `PlayOnLinux` program and navigate to `Tools > Run a local script` to use any of the scripts provided by PUR.

PUR script types:

* Steam = Automatically downloads and installs games from Steam.
* Disc = Requires a CD and/or DVD.
* Digital = Requires at least an executable file. Generally these will be games from GOG.

PUR scripts:

* blizzard_app = Blizzard App (Digital).
    * The Blizzard App client can be used as a base for installing Blizzard games and other Wine dependencies.
* pinball_fx_2 = Pinball FX2 (Steam).
* rise_of_nations = Rise of Nations, Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, Rise of Nations: Gold Edition.
    * There is experimental support for testing out Rise of Nations: Exteneded Edition (Steam).
* star_wars_empire_at_war = Star Wars Empire at War: Gold Pack (Steam).
* star_wars_galaxies = Star Wars Galaxies: The Complete Online Adventures (Disc).
    * The official online servers for this game were shut down in 2011 but unofficial server emulators exist. This script can be used to install the SWGEmu client to be able to connect to SWGEmu servers. PUR does not endorse the use of these servers. Use at your own risk.
* tes_morrowind_steam = The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition (Steam).

The "pol4" (PlayOnLinux 4) directory contains scripts specific to that veresion of PoL. The successor to PlayOnLinux 4 is referred to as the [Phoenicis PlayOnLinux 5 project](https://github.com/PhoenicisOrg/POL-POM-5). This major change requires that PoL scripts now be created using a [JavaScript framework](https://github.com/PhoenicisOrg/Scripts/wiki) instead of using a Bash script.
